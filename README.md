# Linux-Custom-Shell
Written in C, this project is a custom implementation of the linux terminal. Similarly, the project provides a Server / Client implementation where the "main" file (**fp.c** in our case) can be used as a way of giving a command and receiving the output by simply giving the command as an argument ( e.g. **./fp ls | rev** )


## Functionalities
- The user is free to use any sort of command they would want, provided their functionality in the normal Linux terminal.
- File management (the "**cp**" and "**mv**" commands, together with "**dirname**" have been customly implemented
- Infinite piping is customly implemented
- Redirection support is provided for **STDIN** **STDOUT** and **STDERR**
- Mandatorily, all the previously stated points can be used together.

## Extra features
- Simple command history management
- Autocompletion supported
